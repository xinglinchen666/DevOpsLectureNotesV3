# Description
This is the homework for Python and DevOps.

Since we learned how to write cli and use Boto3, let us add a new feature of uploading file to S3 for our devops-cli.

# Task 1: Upload a single to S3 in devops-cli

Tip: 
- Take a look at the handson in boto3.md
- Try to add a new parameter to upload the file to S3, together with the existing as well
- Show the S3 result when the cmd ends.

# Task 2: Upload multiple files given a path to S3 in devops-cli

Tip: given a path parameter, upload all the files under it to S3

# Task 3: Update a new version of devops-cli in PyPi 

Tip: Take a look at pypi.md
